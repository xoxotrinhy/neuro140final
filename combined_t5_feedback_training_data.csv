Thesis,1,"Students were expected to analyze the extent to which beliefs about threats to the United States shaped society from 1917 to 1945. • The question primarily focused on skills of causation, contextualization, document analysis, sourcing, and demonstrating a complex understanding.","Prior to 1917, American society had undergone many rapid changes. The end of slavery and the
ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments marked a significant sociocultural and political
change in America, as Black Americans were able to experience freedom and mobility for the first
time in around a century. With the success of abolition came a growth in the fervor of other reform
movements, such as prohibition and the women's suffrage movement; both of these movements were
able to gain much attention and eventually had their own amendments ratified to the sontitutuon that
guaranteed female suffrage and the prohibition of alcohol. Additionally, the development of
industries led to the Gilded Age, a period of generally increased prosperity for Americans. However,
while America was developing domestically, Europe was facing crises which culminated in the First
World War (WWI) following the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
Though the United States initially maintained neutrality, it eventually entered WWI, which ended not
long after. Around the same time was the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, where the longstanding
tsar Nicolas II was overthrown and replaced by a communist regime. Following the war, there were
many widespread beliefs about threats to the United States, which was significant in shaping society
from 1917 to 1945 by leading to increased isolationism, opposition to communism, and fear of and
disregard for immigrants.
Before WWI, the United States had historically maintained isolationist policies when it came to
European affairs. In his famed Neutrality Proclamation, President George Washington highlighted
the importance of isolation and neutrality from European conflicts. The United States govenrment
had generally followed this advice, although the American empire did expand in the late 1800s and
early 1900s with the annexation of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Yet following
WWI, America largely returned to its isolationist ideals. This is evidenced by Congress's refusal to
ratify the Treaty of Versailles to end WWI with a stipulation for the League of Nations, which was an
international organization proposed by President Woodrow Wilson that would emphasize diplomacy
and negotiation over war. Congressional beliefs regarding the League of Nations are made evident in
a speech given by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, which highlights the US
government's opposition to involvement in international conflict (Doc. 1). Instead, the US
government advocated for isolationism to ensure its own wellbeing, which would subsequently
ensure it was strong enough to guarantee world peace. This document, written from the perspective
of an employee of a government which had just lost lives and resources in a foreign war not of its
great concern, supports the notion that threats to the U.S.'s own wellbeing if it involved itself in more
international conflict shaped the nation's isolationist society and government. However, the opposite
perspective is shown at the start of the Second World War (WWII), as many Americans supported
neutrality initially as they believed they were not threatened by European fascism. A 1939 political
cartoon depicts three U.S. Senators hiding behind a literal wall of neutrality (Doc. 5). This document,
written in the historical conflict of the rise of European fascism and Adolf Hitler's invasion and
annexation of various European territories, supports the notion that the United States society and
government initially maintained neutrality in WWII as it believed it was not threatened by what was
occurring in Europe.
Another prominent belief about threats to the United States that shaped society from 1917 to 1945
was the belief about the infiltration of communism in the United States. Following the end of WWI
and the successful Bolshevik Revolution came a Red Scare in the United States, where many feared
a Communist takeover of the government that posed a threat to the democracy America had only
recently fought to protect. An article written from the perspective of Attorney General A. Mitchell
Palmer, who staunchly opposed communism, described the fear of Americans regarding the spread
of communism and the response of the Justice Department, which swore it would find and detain
any Communist within U.S. borders (Doc. 2). This document describes the beliefs many citizens had 
about the intense threat to American democracy posed by communism and supports the notion that
such beliefs were shaping both American society and the responses of the federal government.
 A final prominent belief about a perceived threat to the United States was the threat that
immigrants posed to the wellbeing of White, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon American society, which led to
many societal prejudices against such grops. A 1924 article written in the historical context of a rise
in immigration following the end of WWI described how immigration rose as a result of American
prosperity and argued that such a rise would harm the native population and reduce its standard of
living (Doc. 3). This document directly showcases how Americans believed that immigrants posed a
threat to their society, and advocated for immigration restrictions, which led to both a societal
prejudice against immigrants and federal quotas restricting immigration. Such prejudices grew with
the advent of WWII and American involvement in the war. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor came an executive order requring the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans and Japanese
immigrants to internment camps due to the military threat of espionage and sabotage. A memoir
written in the historical context of Japanese internment and from the point of view of Sachi Kajiwara,
a Japanese American woman, recalled events at one of these internment camps, describing the
location as being surrounded by barbed wire and police (Doc. 6). This document supports the idea
that the American belief about the threat posed by Japanese Americans significantly shaped society
as it led to the widespread social and political ostracization of Japanese Americans.","The score for Thesis is 1. Generate feedback.

that the American belief about the threat posed by Japanese Americans significantly shaped society
as it led to the widespread social and political ostracization of Japanese Americans.","The response earned 1 point for using evidence from three documents to address the topic of the prompt. The response also earned 1 point for using the content of at least four documents to support an argument in response to the prompt. In total, five documents are used to support an argument. In the second paragraph, Document 1 is used to support an argument that the United States had traditionally followed an isolationist policy. Document 5 is used to support an argument that isolationist sentiment was prominent in the United States prior to the Second World War. In the third paragraph, Document 2 is used to support an argument about how Americans perceived communism as a threat in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. In the fourth paragraph, Documents 3 and 6 are used to support an argument about how “White, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon” Americans perceived immigration as a threat. Using Document 3, the response claims that this perception led to immigration laws being changed along with a rise in social prejudice. Document 6 is used to claim that Japanese Americans were subject to “social and political ostracization” because many Americans viewed them as a threat for espionage and sabotage following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The response earned 1 point for using evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument
about the prompt. In the second paragraph, the response describes the rise of fascism and Adolf
Hitler in Europe."
Analysis,2,"Students were expected to analyze the extent to which beliefs about threats to the United States shaped society from 1917 to 1945. • The question primarily focused on skills of causation, contextualization, document analysis, sourcing, and demonstrating a complex understanding.","Prior to 1917, American society had undergone many rapid changes. The end of slavery and the
ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments marked a significant sociocultural and political
change in America, as Black Americans were able to experience freedom and mobility for the first
time in around a century. With the success of abolition came a growth in the fervor of other reform
movements, such as prohibition and the women's suffrage movement; both of these movements were
able to gain much attention and eventually had their own amendments ratified to the sontitutuon that
guaranteed female suffrage and the prohibition of alcohol. Additionally, the development of
industries led to the Gilded Age, a period of generally increased prosperity for Americans. However,
while America was developing domestically, Europe was facing crises which culminated in the First
World War (WWI) following the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
Though the United States initially maintained neutrality, it eventually entered WWI, which ended not
long after. Around the same time was the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, where the longstanding
tsar Nicolas II was overthrown and replaced by a communist regime. Following the war, there were
many widespread beliefs about threats to the United States, which was significant in shaping society
from 1917 to 1945 by leading to increased isolationism, opposition to communism, and fear of and
disregard for immigrants.
Before WWI, the United States had historically maintained isolationist policies when it came to
European affairs. In his famed Neutrality Proclamation, President George Washington highlighted
the importance of isolation and neutrality from European conflicts. The United States govenrment
had generally followed this advice, although the American empire did expand in the late 1800s and
early 1900s with the annexation of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Yet following
WWI, America largely returned to its isolationist ideals. This is evidenced by Congress's refusal to
ratify the Treaty of Versailles to end WWI with a stipulation for the League of Nations, which was an
international organization proposed by President Woodrow Wilson that would emphasize diplomacy
and negotiation over war. Congressional beliefs regarding the League of Nations are made evident in
a speech given by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, which highlights the US
government's opposition to involvement in international conflict (Doc. 1). Instead, the US
government advocated for isolationism to ensure its own wellbeing, which would subsequently
ensure it was strong enough to guarantee world peace. This document, written from the perspective
of an employee of a government which had just lost lives and resources in a foreign war not of its
great concern, supports the notion that threats to the U.S.'s own wellbeing if it involved itself in more
international conflict shaped the nation's isolationist society and government. However, the opposite
perspective is shown at the start of the Second World War (WWII), as many Americans supported
neutrality initially as they believed they were not threatened by European fascism. A 1939 political
cartoon depicts three U.S. Senators hiding behind a literal wall of neutrality (Doc. 5). This document,
written in the historical conflict of the rise of European fascism and Adolf Hitler's invasion and
annexation of various European territories, supports the notion that the United States society and
government initially maintained neutrality in WWII as it believed it was not threatened by what was
occurring in Europe.
Another prominent belief about threats to the United States that shaped society from 1917 to 1945
was the belief about the infiltration of communism in the United States. Following the end of WWI
and the successful Bolshevik Revolution came a Red Scare in the United States, where many feared
a Communist takeover of the government that posed a threat to the democracy America had only
recently fought to protect. An article written from the perspective of Attorney General A. Mitchell
Palmer, who staunchly opposed communism, described the fear of Americans regarding the spread
of communism and the response of the Justice Department, which swore it would find and detain
any Communist within U.S. borders (Doc. 2). This document describes the beliefs many citizens had 
about the intense threat to American democracy posed by communism and supports the notion that
such beliefs were shaping both American society and the responses of the federal government.
 A final prominent belief about a perceived threat to the United States was the threat that
immigrants posed to the wellbeing of White, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon American society, which led to
many societal prejudices against such grops. A 1924 article written in the historical context of a rise
in immigration following the end of WWI described how immigration rose as a result of American
prosperity and argued that such a rise would harm the native population and reduce its standard of
living (Doc. 3). This document directly showcases how Americans believed that immigrants posed a
threat to their society, and advocated for immigration restrictions, which led to both a societal
prejudice against immigrants and federal quotas restricting immigration. Such prejudices grew with
the advent of WWII and American involvement in the war. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor came an executive order requring the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans and Japanese
immigrants to internment camps due to the military threat of espionage and sabotage. A memoir
written in the historical context of Japanese internment and from the point of view of Sachi Kajiwara,
a Japanese American woman, recalled events at one of these internment camps, describing the
location as being surrounded by barbed wire and police (Doc. 6). This document supports the idea
that the American belief about the threat posed by Japanese Americans significantly shaped society
as it led to the widespread social and political ostracization of Japanese Americans.","The score for Analysis is 2. Generate feedback.

In the fourth paragraph, the historical situation is provided for Document 3, supporting an argument that prejudice against immigrants led to federal laws imposing quotas on immigration. The historical situation is also provided for Document 6, supporting an argument that Japanese internment occurred, in part, because of prejudice against Japanese Americans and Japanesedescended people after the bombing of Pearl Harbor."
Thesis,1,"Students were expected to analyze the extent to which beliefs about threats to the United States shaped society from 1917 to 1945. • The question primarily focused on skills of causation, contextualization, document analysis, sourcing, and demonstrating a complex understanding.","From the time period 1917 to around 1945, the world was evolving in terms of militarisitc
capabilty. The first and second world war had both occured, and nations were in tatters. However,
some nations came back stronger than others, and stronger than ever before. Russia, for exmaple,
had the most casualiteis of any country during the war, but after the second world war, they became
one of the two most powerful countries in the world: America and themselves. Although America had
a strong military and was a domininant global power, many American citizens were still fearful of
foreign threats, which led to many fears like that of communism, atomic attack, and many others.
Americans lived with a fear in the back of their minds that was present everyday, this was the fear of
an attack from Russia or another outisde force. Even during the war, Americans were fearful of their
own neighbors. Japanse Americans were thought to be spies for Japan and plotting against the US.
Not in as a high a degree, but the same goes for German and Italian American. During times of great
threats to the nation, Americans are very fearful of their adversaries, and are constantly suspicious
and on alert.
In document 2, the author mentions that the DOJ will ""pursue the attack of the ""reds"""". The
Reds in this instance are communists living in America during the 1920's who have come from
Russia. He also says that these Reds are trying to ovethrow order and lawfulness in this country.
Just from these few words, already we have a sense that Americans are very suspicious and
paranoid when threrat levels are high, and their day to day lives are lived in paranoia. A growing
hatred for these Reds was also a major theme during this time. Large masses of people sometimes
could be seen in the streets demanding that all Reds be arrested or killed. Overall, the majority of
Americans had a growing hatred and fear of Reds, because they beleived they were everywhere,
spying on their every move.
Document 3 explicitly says that immigration should be more restricted, and that the influx of
immigrants is going to decrease the living standard, and that the country will become poorer and
less sophisticated overtime. However, this points at something larger that continues to be in
American society to this day. Americans remain fearful of immigrants because they believe that
some of them are spies and have malintent when they come to the US. Especially during a time of
high threat, like ww1 or ww2 as mentioned earlier, Americans are much more fearful and paranoid,
so naturally, they would not want more foreigners who come from the belligernet nations to enter the
US. Document 3 hints at the existing and underlying fear of new people coming from foreign lands.
The very fear that Amercians have has led them to fear immigrants, which is what all Amercians are
in the first place.
Furthermore, document 5 depicts three US senators who can be seen hiding behind a wall of
sandbags, protected from the distant explosions that can be seen coming from Europe. This can be
attributed to ""isolationism"", which is what Amercia stood by during both world wars, that is before
they entered both of them. Americans feared the massive conflicts that were occurring in Europe
during ww1 and 2, which is why they tried to stay out of them as long as possible. Americans
wanted no part of national conflict, because that same fear of getting entangled into a mssive conflict
was everpresent in their minds. Once again, this just goes to show how fear of getting involved
contributed to the growing support of isolationsim.
Also, document 6 sheds some light on what is what like living in a Japanese interment camp.
But, what needs to be extracted and learned from this document is that Americans were so fearful
and paranoid of Japanese people during ww2, that innocent civilians who wer hard working
American patriots were rounded up and contained in designated spaces, so that they did not pose
any threat to anyone else. It just goes to show further the true level of Paranoia that was in everyones
minds at the time was at an all time high, and day to day life was changing due to this fear. Just like
Americans were fearful of the Japanese during ww2, they were fearful of an atomic attack during the 
cold war. Americans were tought what safety measures to take if a bomb was to ever be dropped on
them, even young children knew what to do. ""Bert the Turtle"" was an ad campaign made by the
government to demonstatre to children esspecially what to do if a bomb was ever dropped.
Homeowners even made thier own bomb shelters in the backyards out of fear of a bomb being
dropped. It goes to show that even on TV, Americans were reminded of their fears everyday, and life
became a game of survival and being aware of your surroundings at all times.","The score for Thesis is 1. Generate feedback.

capabilty. The first and second world war had both occured, and nations were in tatters. However,
some nations came back stronger than others, and stronger than ever before. Russia, for exmaple,
had the most casualiteis of any country during the war, but after the second world war, they became
one of the two most powerful countries in the world: America and themselves. Although America had
a strong military and was a domininant global power, many American citizens were still fearful of
foreign threats, which led to many fears like that of communism, atomic attack, and many others.
Americans lived with a fear in the back of their minds that was present everyday, this was the fear of
an attack from Russia or another outisde force. Even during the war, Americans were fearful of their
own neighbors. Japanse Americans were thought to be spies for Japan and plotting against the US.
Not in as a high a degree, but the same goes for German and Italian American. During times of great
threats to the nation, Americans are very fearful of their adversaries, and are constantly suspicious
and on alert.
In document 2, the author mentions that the DOJ will ""pursue the attack of the ""reds"""". The
Reds in this instance are communists living in America during the 1920's who have come from
Russia. He also says that these Reds are trying to ovethrow order and lawfulness in this country.
Just from these few words, already we have a sense that Americans are very suspicious and
paranoid when threrat levels are high, and their day to day lives are lived in paranoia. A growing
hatred for these Reds was also a major theme during this time. Large masses of people sometimes
could be seen in the streets demanding that all Reds be arrested or killed. Overall, the majority of
Americans had a growing hatred and fear of Reds, because they beleived they were everywhere,
spying on their every move.
Document 3 explicitly says that immigration should be more restricted, and that the influx of
immigrants is going to decrease the living standard, and that the country will become poorer and
less sophisticated overtime. However, this points at something larger that continues to be in
American society to this day. Americans remain fearful of immigrants because they believe that
some of them are spies and have malintent when they come to the US. Especially during a time of
high threat, like ww1 or ww2 as mentioned earlier, Americans are much more fearful and paranoid,
so naturally, they would not want more foreigners who come from the belligernet nations to enter the
US. Document 3 hints at the existing and underlying fear of new people coming from foreign lands.
The very fear that Amercians have has led them to fear immigrants, which is what all Amercians are
in the first place.
Furthermore, document 5 depicts three US senators who can be seen hiding behind a wall of
sandbags, protected from the distant explosions that can be seen coming from Europe. This can be
attributed to ""isolationism"", which is what Amercia stood by during both world wars, that is before
they entered both of them. Americans feared the massive conflicts that were occurring in Europe
during ww1 and 2, which is why they tried to stay out of them as long as possible. Americans
wanted no part of national conflict, because that same fear of getting entangled into a mssive conflict
was everpresent in their minds. Once again, this just goes to show how fear of getting involved
contributed to the growing support of isolationsim.
Also, document 6 sheds some light on what is what like living in a Japanese interment camp.
But, what needs to be extracted and learned from this document is that Americans were so fearful
and paranoid of Japanese people during ww2, that innocent civilians who wer hard working
American patriots were rounded up and contained in designated spaces, so that they did not pose
any threat to anyone else. It just goes to show further the true level of Paranoia that was in everyones
minds at the time was at an all time high, and day to day life was changing due to this fear. Just like
Americans were fearful of the Japanese during ww2, they were fearful of an atomic attack during the 
cold war. Americans were tought what safety measures to take if a bomb was to ever be dropped on
them, even young children knew what to do. ""Bert the Turtle"" was an ad campaign made by the
government to demonstatre to children esspecially what to do if a bomb was ever dropped.
Homeowners even made thier own bomb shelters in the backyards out of fear of a bomb being
dropped. It goes to show that even on TV, Americans were reminded of their fears everyday, and life
became a game of survival and being aware of your surroundings at all times.","The score for Evidence is 2. Generate feedback.

The response also earned 1 point for using evidence from four documents to support an argument in response to the prompt. In the second paragraph, Document 2 is used to illustrate the growing fear and paranoia of Americans in relation to the “Reds” that the Department of Justice was pursuing, with concerns that communists were “everywhere” and could be anyone, forcing citizens to be constantly watchful. In the third paragraph, Document 3 is used to support an argument the fears of citizens that some immigrants were “spies and have malintent” contributed to immigration restriction. In the fourth paragraph, Document 5 is used to illustrate the fears that Americans had of becoming entangled in the conflicts going on in Europe during the Second World War helped fuel isolationist sentiment. In the final paragraph, Document 6 is used to show the level of paranoia that some Americans had that led to the internment of innocent Japanese Americans. Evidence Beyond the Documents The response earned 1 point for using at least one specific piece of historical evidence relevant to the extent to which beliefs about threats to the United States shaped society. In the fourth paragraph, the response discusses isolationism, the policy that Americans adhered to during the First and Second World War prior to entering the conflicts. The response effectively elaborates upon what isolationism entailed, rather than being a passing phrase or reference."

way that society was run.
Starting in document two the historical context of document two is the First Red Scare. The First
Red Scare was the fear of Americans that the Soviet Union's communist influence would break into
American land. The fear of this communism led to a lack in trust in the government in America.
Following the second World War was the emrgance of the Second Red Scare which soon turned into
the Cold War. The second red scare was still the fear of communism and now also the fear of the
spread of communism throughout Europe and Asia. This also soon sparked the Vietnam war under
the Domino theory, which was to strive for containment of communism. The constant fear of
communism amoung Americans resulted in effects on society as people were being accused and
condemned for being supposed communists.
In document five the purpose of the image is to promote neutrality. The United States declared
neutrality from the second World War until later in the war. The idea of nuetrality also shaped
American society during the time period because it prevented American men from being forced to go
fight in the war.
The historical context of document six was the Japenese internment in the US during WW2. During
world war two the US was nuetral, despite having helped its previous allies Britian through the Lend
Lease act, it was technically nuetral. Once the Japanese attack an American naval at Pearl Harbor,
the US retracted it's nuetrality and declared war on Japan. After this had happened there were
concerns about Japenese-Americans living in the US and the government forcefully put JapaneseAmericans into internment camps. The supposed threat of enemy spies shaped US society largely as
it created a prejudice against Japanese-American citizens and other minorities like Italian and
German-Americans.

War, americans fought overseas to utilize the opportunity to provide a better life for their children.
This shaped society back in the US as many men were over seas, women had to join the work force
to support the family, which was against the norm at the time. The second world war introduced

Following the second World War was the emrgance of the Second Red Scare which soon turned into
the Cold War. The second red scare was still the fear of communism and now also the fear of the
spread of communism throughout Europe and Asia. This also soon sparked the Vietnam war under
the Domino theory, which was to strive for containment of communism. The constant fear of
communism amoung Americans resulted in effects on society as people were being accused and
condemned for being supposed communists.
In document five the purpose of the image is to promote neutrality. The United States declared
neutrality from the second World War until later in the war. The idea of nuetrality also shaped
American society during the time period because it prevented American men from being forced to go
fight in the war.
The historical context of document six was the Japenese internment in the US during WW2. During
world war two the US was nuetral, despite having helped its previous allies Britian through the Lend
Lease act, it was technically nuetral. Once the Japanese attack an American naval at Pearl Harbor,
the US retracted it's nuetrality and declared war on Japan. After this had happened there were
concerns about Japenese-Americans living in the US and the government forcefully put JapaneseAmericans into internment camps. The supposed threat of enemy spies shaped US society largely as
it created a prejudice against Japanese-American citizens and other minorities like Italian and
German-Americans.
Finally in document seven the historical context of the document is that during the Second World
War, americans fought overseas to utilize the opportunity to provide a better life for their children.
This shaped society back in the US as many men were over seas, women had to join the work force
to support the family, which was against the norm at the time. The second world war introduced
many women into the workforce and once the war was over many of those women stayed in the

Thesis,1,Evaluate the extent to which the growth of transatlantic trade changed British North American colonial society from 1607 to 1776.,"Since the beginning of the Era of Exploration, European nations had been funding groundbreaking navigation trips to never-before-explored areas, developing colonies, and establishing trade. Explorers such as Vasco De Gama, Ferdinand Magellen, Christopher Columbus were funded by monarchs such as Isabella of Spain and aided by technology such as carvel ships and astrolabes. Once landed, nations quickly established colonies, with those such as Spanish conquistadors using immense force to combat Native populations. The unique resources and immense wealth brought about by these colonies were exchanged throughout trade routes, one of the most notable being the transatlantic trade route. Although it furthered the British North American colonies' ties to England, transatlantic trade succeeded in drastically changing the British North American colonial society to large extent by leading to the development of distinct regions throughout the colonies and leading to the dependence of Southern society on slave labor. To begin with, the transatlantic trade involved many of the British North American colonies, but, at each port, different items were exchanged, leading to the development of distinct economical regions between these colonies; these unique economies, in turn, shaped British American colonial society. For example, the Massachussetts Bay Colony in the northern region had originally been founded on the principle of religious tolerance (for select religions excluding Catholicism and Judaism). Located along the coast, this colony quickly became apart of transatlantic trade, which led to the formation of the colony's economy. The economy of the Massachussetts Bay Colony became based around fishing, but, more importantly, shipbuilding, as a merchant class evolved within this economy and sought to partake in the transatlantic trade. As a result, this colony was more reliant on commerce than agriculture, leading to tightly spaced and closer knit communities, allowing these societies to become more connected and reliant on the church. In the South, the colony of Virginia was originally founded upon the principles of ""God, Gold, and Glory"". However, after harsh seasons and the discovery of the absence of gold, the colonists grew discontent. But, the transatlantic slave trade gradually increased the wealth of Virginian colonists by encouraging these colonists to grow and trade crops, such as tobacco, a cash crop, in the profitable transatlantic trade. As a result, the Virginian economy became reliant on agriculture, a lot of land was dedicated to farming, and societies became more spread out and less tightly knit than Northern colonies. In addition to creating distinct regions, the transatlantic trade introduced Southern colonies to slave labor and gradually increased these colonies' dependence on slave labor over time. For example, in 1607, the first Africans arrived in Virginia, but it was a very small amount. More importantly, these Africans arrived as indentured servants, with freedom promised to them after a designated number of years of service. However, the development of the transatlantic trade made the South reliant on slaves not only by demanding more and more agricultural output from the South, but also by supplying the South with the slaves through the transatlantic slave trade. In the transatlantic slave trade, Europeans in Africa would kidnap Africans or bribe African tribes to kidnap rival tribe members put on ships destined for British North America. Once these ships reached the South, the slaves were auctioned off. The increase of slave labor in the South also led the creation of Southern plantations, a unique characteristic of Southern society that represented the South even after the transatlantic slave trade ended (this is evident in media such as Gone with the Wind). While the transatlantic trade may have created regions and developed slavery, it did act as a continuity in furthering the British North American colonies' ties with England. As a crucial part of transatlantic trade, the colonies sold much of their raw materials to consumers in England. The profits from this trade constituted a large part of the colonial economy and made the colonies dependent on England. For example, when the colonists were angry at the Tea Act, which gave the British East India Company a monopoly over the tea trade, colonists rebelled through the Boston Tea Party, in which vast amounts of expensive of tea were dumped into the Boston Harbor. The colonists retaliated in this way because they were angry that England had the ability to grant monopoly rights to the British East India Company but they also acknowledged that by ruining the tea, they were harming the crucial economic tie between the colonies in England. Considering this example and others, it begins to be revealed that the transatlantic trade actually did cause change in relation to the colonies and England in that it stirred political activism in colonial society by creating a tie so strong that the colonists felt no choice but to retaliate and break this economic bond with England as part of a way to obtain independence in their economies, politics, and society.","The score for Thesis is 1.

The profits from this trade constituted a large part of the colonial economy and made the colonies dependent on England. For example, when the colonists were angry at the Tea Act, which gave the British East India Company a monopoly over the tea trade, colonists rebelled through the Boston Tea Party, in which vast amounts of expensive of tea were dumped into the Boston Harbor. The colonists retaliated in this way because they were angry that England had the ability to grant monopoly rights to the British East India Company but they also acknowledged that by ruining the tea, they were harming the crucial economic tie between the colonies in England. Considering this example and others, it begins to be revealed that the transatlantic trade actually did cause change in relation to the colonies and England in that it stirred political activism in colonial society by creating a tie so strong that the colonists felt no choice but to retaliate and break this economic bond with England as part of a way to obtain independence in their economies, politics, and society.","The score for Evidence is 2. Generate feedback. Question: Evaluate the extent to which the growth of transatlantic trade changed British North American colonial society from 1607 to 1776. Response: Since the beginning of the Era of Exploration, European nations had been funding groundbreaking navigation trips to never-before-explored areas, developing colonies, and establishing trade. Explorers such as Vasco De Gama, Ferdinand Magellen, Christopher Columbus were funded by monarchs such as Isabella of Spain and aided by technology such as carvel ships and astrolabes. Once landed, nations quickly established colonies, with those such as Spanish conquistadors using immense force to combat Native populations. The unique resources and immense wealth brought about by these colonies were exchanged throughout trade routes, one of the most notable being the transatlantic trade route. Although it furthered the British North American colonies' ties to England, transatlantic trade succeeded in drastically changing the British North American colonial society to large extent by leading to the development of distinct regions throughout the colonies and leading to the dependence of Southern society on slave labor. To begin with, the transatlantic trade involved many of the British North American colonies, but, at each port, different items were exchanged, leading to the development of distinct economical regions between these colonies; these unique economies, in turn, shaped British American colonial society. For example, the Massachussetts Bay Colony in the northern region had originally been founded on the principle of religious tolerance (for select religions excluding Catholicism and Judaism). Located along the coast, this colony quickly became apart of transatlantic trade, which led to the formation of the colony's economy. The economy of the Massachussetts Bay Colony became based around fishing, but, more importantly, shipbuilding, as a merchant class evolved within this economy and sought to partake in the transatlantic trade. As a result, this colony was more reliant on commerce than agriculture, leading to tightly spaced and closer knit communities, allowing these societies to become more connected and reliant on the church. In the South, the colony of Virginia was originally founded upon the principles of ""God, Gold, and Glory"". However, after harsh seasons and the discovery of the absence of gold, the colonists grew discontent. But, the transatlantic slave trade gradually increased the wealth of Virginian colonists by encouraging these colonists to grow and trade crops, such as tobacco, a cash crop, in the profitable transatlantic trade. As a result, the Virginian economy became reliant on agriculture, a lot of land was dedicated to farming, and societies became more spread out and less tightly knit than Northern colonies. In addition to creating distinct regions, the transatlantic trade introduced Southern colonies to slave labor and gradually increased these colonies' dependence on slave labor over time. For example, in 1607, the first Africans arrived in Virginia, but it was a very small amount. More importantly, these Africans arrived as indentured servants, with freedom promised to them after a designated number of years of service. However, the development of the transatlantic trade made the South reliant on slaves not only by demanding more and more agricultural output from the South, but also by supplying the South with the slaves through the transatlantic slave trade. In the transatlantic slave trade, Europeans in Africa would kidnap Africans or bribe African tribes to kidnap rival tribe members put on ships destined for British North America. Once these ships reached the South, the slaves were auctioned off. The increase of slave labor in the South also led the creation of Southern plantations, a unique characteristic of Southern society that represented the South even after the transatlantic slave trade ended (this is evident in media such as Gone with the Wind).

For example, in the middle of the second paragraph, the response identifies that “the Massachussetts Bay Colony in the northern region had originally been founded on the principle of religious tolerance.” Also, in the same paragraph, the response identifies a second example that this colony’s economy was “based around fishing, but more importantly shipbuilding.” The response earned 1 point for using at least two specific historical examples to support an argument.

In the fourth paragraph, the response claims that transatlantic trade also provided continuity in the development of the colonies by “furthering the British North American colonies’ ties with England.” The response then goes on to demonstrate an understanding of this continuity by identifying the economic linkage between raw materials being exported from the colonies and sold to consumers in England. The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding. The response corroborates its argument about economic developments across colonial regions. The second paragraph contains a nuanced discussion of the evolving merchant class in Massachusetts and the Virginian economy that grew to become reliant on agriculture after the introduction of tobacco. The conclusion of the fourth paragraph also extends the discussion of the continuity of economic ties by claiming that colonists who were angered by the Tea Act began protesting by destroying tea specifically because it was such a strong symbol of their ties with the mother country."

Response: The arrival of Columbus in the Americas had set off a larrge and immense movment of people from all the major coutnries of the Netherlands, Spain, France, and the British to North and South America. The British, however, was the the main powera as thir navy was the storngest amongst any of his other opponents, and had the wealth and resoures to be able to take the area of land East of North America to form its colonies. They had established the city of Jamestown, the first permanent colonial settlement, and were able to expand with the ability of their large military power to form a total of 13 colonies connectign each other through the Atlantic Ocean. From the period of 1607 to 1776, the growth of the transatlantic slave trade changed British North American colonial society as it started to bring an exahnge of large amoutns of goods and reosurces while also prioriting the idea of mercantilism in the colonies. However, the trade had also establsihed the use of slavery in the predominant Southern colonies whose effect would last for years to come even after American independcne.

Thesis,1,Evaluate the extent to which changes in United States foreign policy contributed to territorial growth from 1840 to 1898.,"From even before the Revolution, Americans wanted to spread west. This idea of Manifest Destiny had always existed in the American heart and mind. After the American revolution and the Proclamation of 1763 no longer applied, of which colonists ignored, many more Americans went to western territories. This expansion eventually lead them to run into other countries like Spanish Mexico and British Canada. Despite the annexation of Texas and much of the Southwestern United States, American foreign policy contributed very little to territorial growth from 1840 to 1898. The Annexation of Texas was not an act of foreign policy, but rather an act of the people calling upon Manifest Destiny, and the government response to it. Let me explain, people started moving to Texas after the Mexican government allowed American citizens to settle there under a few conditions. Many of these Americans ignored these conditions and settled there anyway, and eventually these Americans made a majority within the territory and decided they didn't want to be apart of Mexico anymore so they fought back. The Americans living there then wanted to be a part of the United States, but they weren't annexed for a time because of United States domestic policy, namely the Missouri Compromise. Although the United States did eventually go to war with mexico and a lot of territory, it wasn't an act of a change in foreign policy but rather the government reacting to the actions of the people that lead to the United States gaining territories like Texas, California, and New Mexico. The Spanish American War was justified by acting upon the Monroe Doctrine, a piece of United States Foreign policy, but it was largely caused by the actions and pressures by the people not foreign policy. In Spanish Cuba, the Spanish were oppressing upon the Native Cubans that lived there, and Yellow Journalism encouraged many Americans that we needed to do something about it, based on moral grounds. The Navy at this time had also been expanding as a result of Alfred Thayer Mahans book, ""The Influence of the Sea upon History"", which talked of expanding the navy to have a greater presence and impact upon history, which Americans wanted. Because of this increased military power, we felt compelled to use it, which later President Eisenhower warned about in his farewell address. Eventually these two factors combined when the USS Maine blew up in a Cuban Harbor, which the Yellow Journalists blamed the Spanish and called for war, although later investigations revealed that it had been an accidental internal explosion and wasn't related to the Spanish at all. In the end the Spanish American war which saw the United States gain territories in Puerto Rico and indirectly Hawaii, as well as imperial strongholds in Cuba and the Phillipines, was caused by the will of the people, not changes in United States foreign policy.

Although the United States did eventually go to war with mexico and a lot of territory, it wasn't an act of a change in foreign policy but rather the government reacting to the actions of the people that lead to the United States gaining territories like Texas, California, and New Mexico. The Spanish American War was justified by acting upon the Monroe Doctrine, a piece of United States Foreign policy, but it was largely caused by the actions and pressures by the people not foreign policy. In Spanish Cuba, the Spanish were oppressing upon the Native Cubans that lived there, and Yellow Journalism encouraged many Americans that we needed to do something about it, based on moral grounds. The Navy at this time had also been expanding as a result of Alfred Thayer Mahans book, ""The Influence of the Sea upon History"", which talked of expanding the navy to have a greater presence and impact upon history, which Americans wanted. Because of this increased military power, we felt compelled to use it, which later President Eisenhower warned about in his farewell address. Eventually these two factors combined when the USS Maine blew up in a Cuban Harbor, which the Yellow Journalists blamed the Spanish and called for war, although later investigations revealed that it had been an accidental internal explosion and wasn't related to the Spanish at all. In the end the Spanish American war which saw the United States gain territories in Puerto Rico and indirectly Hawaii, as well as imperial strongholds in Cuba and the Phillipines, was caused by the will of the people, not changes in United States foreign policy. Despite the fact that the United States territory expanded from 1840 to 1898, it was as a result of actions of the people and the government responding to such actions, rather than changes to foreign policy.","The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning of causation to structure an argument relevant to the prompt. It argues that the “actions and pressures by the people” of the United States caused territorial expansion. The response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding, using evidence to modify an argument that addresses the topic of the prompt. Throughout the essay, evidence of the annexation of Texas, the Mexican-American War, and the Spanish-American War is used to modify an argument to claim that more than top-down foreign policy decisions, American popular opinion contributed to territorial growth between 1840 and 1898."
Thesis,1,Evaluate the extent to which changes in United States foreign policy contributed to territorial growth from 1840 to 1898.,"In the early 1800s, America quickly revolutionized its tactics in agricultural practices and therefore required the need for new land, since the South had ultimately deployed its soil from nutrients due to the quick paced machienery of the cotton gin. Additionally, Manifest Destiny in the the U.S and its action in part due to it by expanding westward and creating the Trail of Tears to remove native americans from desired land, had influenced an emergence to expand in territory. By the 1820s and foward, America had quickly set its goal on expanding in order to dominate the western hemisphere and to play a larger part in its country. Despite many arguing that foreign relatios had a low role in the territorial growth of the United States in the later half of the 1800s, foreign policy ultimately regarded the most influencial in the development of expansion of territory in the United States as a result of war with countries, annexations, and buyings off on foreign territories. Foreign policy ultimately had the largest role in America's territorial growth due to wars that America fought in. By the 1930s, America had the desire to move westward as a result of manifest destiny and its 'god given power' that was rewarded to them. Therefore, America desired to take Texas, Oregon, Arizona, and many other west regions, however, it could not due to the region being occupied and owned by Mexico. As a result, the United States interacted with war with Mexico, ultimately transforming into the Mexican American War. However, it soon became destructive for Mexican forces, Mexico surrendered and with the Treaty of Hildago, indicating the northern regions of Mexico were given up to become part of the United States. As a result, the foreign policy of the United States heavily influenced growth in territory due to the introduction of new land seen in the Mexican-American War. Another reason for foreign policy being the greatest factor in bringing in territorial growth was due to annexations and buyings of land. For instance, in the late 19th century, America had begun its imperialistic acts in order to influence its growing markets and was seeking to sell to great populations of consumers. However, the United States first needed to grow its goods in order to sell. As a result, when the Dole company found Hawaii, a foreign territory, to be the best place to grow its pineapple agriculture, it requested for the U.S to aquire the land. During the late 1800s, America focuesed heavily on businesses and granted the Dole company the land by removing the Hawaiian monarchy. Therefore, with the account of annexing Hawaii and removing their monarchy for the countries and companies' benefits, the U.S was able to grow in size and expanded in territory from foreign land. Another reason for foreign policy being the largest role in territory growth was due to the purchase of land. As the United States moved westward and Imperialism in America was on the rise, the desire for further expansion and greater western influence continued. Therefore, when looking into areas to expand, the U.S looked North to the region that was held by Russia, which would soon become Alasaka. As a result, America had purchased Alaska from Russia and quickly expanded in territory. Therefore, purchase was a factor into foreign policy creating territory because the U.S was allowed to buy Russian land and by purchasing land, the U.S created greater expansion, which was their desire.","The score for Thesis is 1.

Thesis,0,Evaluate the extent to which changes in United States foreign policy contributed to territorial growth from 1840 to 1898.,"The Growth of the territorial United States was changed because of foreign policy which allowed the USA to achieve and acquire such land.

The Mexican-American war only started due to a foreign policy allowing Americans to enter Texas, and with them came slavery, and Texas wanting to be free. All this tension due to foreign policy lead to the Alamo(""Remember the Alamo"") and united states declaring war on Mexico.

Thesis,1,Evaluate the extent to which growing concerns about national security contributed to changes in United States foreign policy from 1945 to 1991.,"During world war one, Russia left the war because they had their own civil war which produced the communist soviet union. This had the effect of producing the first red scare in the United States, where xenophobia and fear of communist infiltration were extremely high. After this died down, in between the years of world war one and world war two, the united states entered a period of isolationism and were not involved in foreign conflicts. However, the attack on pearl harbor by Japan made the united states enter the war directly. Even when the USSR and United States were on the same side, tensions were still high between the two countries because of opposing ideologies. The Soviet union and the United states emerged from World War II as the global superpowers, and with the United states seeing itself as the global protector of democracy, it would conflict with the soviet union. The extent to which growing concerns about national security contributed to changes in foreign policy was significant, due to the red scare, the domino effect, and the buildup of nuclear weapons. Following world war two, the cold war started between the united states and the soviet union, or rather capitalism and communism. The first big major change in foreign policy was the fact that the United States joined their first peace-time military alliance ever with NATO. They had never done this before, but fear of a soviet offensive caused them to join it and to support eastern Europe from communism, which can also be seen through the Marshall plan. Ever since Washingtons farewell adress, the U.S had never joined a foreign organization outside in the middle of a war, and this is seen during the first world war where congress denied joining the league of nations because it would tie them to foreign affairs. So with them joining NATO, we can see just how much national security concerns contributed to changes in foreign policiy. Not only that, we see the United States involve themself in proxy wars around the world against communism. We see this with the korean war and vietnam war. With the vietnam war, the United States kept spending and spending to support the south against the north, and kept promising the people at home that we were close to victory. However, this was the first major war that was put on television, so the people at home saw that in reality, the united states were not winning and could better be described as losing the war. Point being, national security concerns led to proxy wars in Asia and around the world because the U.S came up with the domino effect, saying that if they let one country in Asia become communist, the rest would soon fall to it, producing a domino effect which would eventually reach the united states. Another thing that was new in foreign policy was the massive amount of economic aid solely for the purpose of fighting another ideology. The marshall plan was for eastern european countries and so that they would depend on united states and their capitalism ideology, the plan resembled reconstruction efforts after the civil war in the U.S but here we see the U.S be directly involved with construction of foreign economies. National security concerns also gave birth to the second rare scare, which deported many immigrants. We also see the united states station troops in other countries and oversee them, such as in East Germany. The Berlin wall was hotly contested between the U.S and Soviet union, and the U.S employed the Berlin Air Lift to ship in goods to West Berlin because it was blocked off to the east. All these foreign policy changes fall under one principle that was prevalent during this time period, and that was the idea of containment. Starting with Truman, the U.S was devoted to being involved in foreign affairs to make sure that they contained the spread of soviet communism and to keep it from reaching other countries.

Even when the USSR and United States were on the same side, tensions were still high between the two countries because of opposing ideologies. The Soviet union and the United states emerged from World War II as the global superpowers, and with the United states seeing itself as the global protector of democracy, it would conflict with the soviet union. The extent to which growing concerns about national security contributed to changes in foreign policy was significant, due to the red scare, the domino effect, and the buildup of nuclear weapons. Following world war two, the cold war started between the united states and the soviet union, or rather capitalism and communism. The first big major change in foreign policy was the fact that the United States joined their first peace-time military alliance ever with NATO. They had never done this before, but fear of a soviet offensive caused them to join it and to support eastern Europe from communism, which can also be seen through the Marshall plan. Ever since Washingtons farewell adress, the U.S had never joined a foreign organization outside in the middle of a war, and this is seen during the first world war where congress denied joining the league of nations because it would tie them to foreign affairs. So with them joining NATO, we can see just how much national security concerns contributed to changes in foreign policiy. Not only that, we see the United States involve themself in proxy wars around the world against communism. We see this with the korean war and vietnam war. With the vietnam war, the United States kept spending and spending to support the south against the north, and kept promising the people at home that we were close to victory. However, this was the first major war that was put on television, so the people at home saw that in reality, the united states were not winning and could better be described as losing the war. Point being, national security concerns led to proxy wars in Asia and around the world because the U.S came up with the domino effect, saying that if they let one country in Asia become communist, the rest would soon fall to it, producing a domino effect which would eventually reach the united states. Another thing that was new in foreign policy was the massive amount of economic aid solely for the purpose of fighting another ideology. The marshall plan was for eastern european countries and so that they would depend on united states and their capitalism ideology, the plan resembled reconstruction efforts after the civil war in the U.S but here we see the U.S be directly involved with construction of foreign economies. National security concerns also gave birth to the second rare scare, which deported many immigrants. We also see the united states station troops in other countries and oversee them, such as in East Germany. The Berlin wall was hotly contested between the U.S and Soviet union, and the U.S employed the Berlin Air Lift to ship in goods to West Berlin because it was blocked off to the east. All these foreign policy changes fall under one principle that was prevalent during this time period, and that was the idea of containment. Starting with Truman, the U.S was devoted to being involved in foreign affairs to make sure that they contained the spread of soviet communism and to keep it from reaching other countries. This was only sparked even more when Cuba and Castro ovethrow their dictatorship and installed a communist goverment, because seeing that ideology so close to their home only inrpired national swcu","The response earned 2 points for evidence. The response identifies specific examples relevant to the prompt, such as the Cold War and the Berlin Airlift. The response earned the second point because it supports the argument in response to the prompt by using specific historical evidence. For example, it argues that the proxy wars in Korea and Vietnam were a product of the domino theory and that the Marshall Plan’s economic aid was motivated by the United States’ desire to promote capitalism in Europe."

Thesis,1,Evaluate the extent to which growing concerns about national security contributed to changes in United States foreign policy from 1945 to 1991.,"Before 1945, the United States had tried to establish an isolationist foreign policy. Due to the outcome of the first world war the United States hoped to rebuild their economy and build a military, yet keep out of any foreign affairs for as long as possible. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor the U.S. was pushed into WW2 causing them to change their ideas about foreign policy. Following the war, the U.S. and Soviet Union stood off in the Cold War with threat of nuclear war. So from 1945-1991 the United States' action in many ""wars"" contributed greatly to its changes in foreign policy. To begin, the United States had hoped to stay out of World War 2 as much as possible until the attack on Pearl Harbor. Before the ambush, the U.S. had supplied money and weapons to European countries fighting in the war. Their foreign policy remained neutral and no sides were officially taken as the shipments were available to any country willing get it. However, the axis powers believed that the U.S. was clearly favoring the allies which resulted in their initial attack. Following the attack, the U.S. had completely changed its forign policy and changed focus to win the war and help the allies. Rather then building the economy, they built a military and thousands of men and women were sent to help in Europe. Throughout the war the United States thrived and risked little to no dangers on the nation itself as it was across the entire ocean. Nonetheless, the risk of communism crossing the atlantic if the axis powers had won was enough to keep fighting. Following the war, the United States took control of recovery process. They provided aid to all countries involved and established the Marshall Plan in order to prevent future wars and rebuild Europe. During this period the United States, had to adapt a new foreign policy multiple times to fight in a war and help recovery from it. Furthermore, the United States and Soviet Union entered a stand-off which arguably could have begun the next world war. Shortly after the WW2, the Soviet Union and U.S. threatened a nuclear war on each other. Although, it just remained threats and lies, the danger was there. Throughout the cold war, espionage and scandals flooded the government and people began to have little trust in each other. The U.S. military built bases in neighboring countries to the U.S.S.R and remained as informed as possible. Foreign Policy was built around obtaining information and not starting the war, but only reacting. The threat to national security contributed greatly to foreign policy as new allies were formed and deals were created to stay out of trouble. To conclude, the period from 1945 to 1991 contributed significantly to the changes in foreign policy. Constant threat to national security during the Second World War and Cold war forced the military to take action and stay on their toes. While this period was primarily an era of war, many treaties and pacts were created to eventually end major wars. Due to the constant action of the era it is less common to see so much foreign violence today, which is why it can be argued as one of the more influential periods in U.S. history.","The score for Thesis is 1.

Due to the constant action of the era it is less common to see so much foreign violence today, which is why it can be argued as one of the more influential periods in U.S. history.","The score for Analysis is 1. Generate feedback. Question: Evaluate the extent to which growing concerns about national security contributed to changes in United States foreign policy from 1945 to 1991. Response: Before 1945, the United States had tried to establish an isolationist foreign policy. Due to the outcome of the first world war the United States hoped to rebuild their economy and build a military, yet keep out of any foreign affairs for as long as possible. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor the U.S. was pushed into WW2 causing them to change their ideas about foreign policy. Following the war, the U.S. and Soviet Union stood off in the Cold War with threat of nuclear war. So from 1945-1991 the United States' action in many ""wars"" contributed greatly to its changes in foreign policy. To begin, the United States had hoped to stay out of World War 2 as much as possible until the attack on Pearl Harbor. Before the ambush, the U.S. had supplied money and weapons to European countries fighting in the war. Their foreign policy remained neutral and no sides were officially taken as the shipments were available to any country willing get it. However, the axis powers believed that the U.S. was clearly favoring the allies which resulted in their initial attack. Following the attack, the U.S. had completely changed its forign policy and changed focus to win the war and help the allies. Rather then building the economy, they built a military and thousands of men and women were sent to help in Europe. Throughout the war the United States thrived and risked little to no dangers on the nation itself as it was across the entire ocean. Nonetheless, the risk of communism crossing the atlantic if the axis powers had won was enough to keep fighting. Following the war, the United States took control of recovery process. They provided aid to all countries involved and established the Marshall Plan in order to prevent future wars and rebuild Europe. During this period the United States, had to adapt a new foreign policy multiple times to fight in a war and help recovery from it. Furthermore, the United States and Soviet Union entered a stand-off which arguably could have begun the next world war. Shortly after the WW2, the Soviet Union and U.S. threatened a nuclear war on each other. Although, it just remained threats and lies, the danger was there. Throughout the cold war, espionage and scandals flooded the government and people began to have little trust in each other. The U.S. military built bases in neighboring countries to the U.S.S.R and remained as informed as possible. Foreign Policy was built around obtaining information and not starting the war, but only reacting. The threat to national security contributed greatly to foreign policy as new allies were formed and deals were created to stay out of trouble. To conclude, the period from 1945 to 1991 contributed significantly to the changes in foreign policy. Constant threat to national security during the Second World War and Cold war forced the military to take action and stay on their toes. While this period was primarily an era of war, many treaties and pacts were created to eventually end major wars. Due to the constant action of the era it is less common to see so much foreign violence today, which is why it can be argued as one of the more influential periods in U.S. history.","The response earned 1 point for using historical reasoning to structure an argument that addresses the prompt.
